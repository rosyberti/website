In this course, we will be using the Anaconda distribution of Python for all of our visualizations. Within the Anaconda distribution, we will be working in [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/), which is a type of web-based application that allows you create living documents that cnotain live code, mathematical equations, explanatory text, visualizations, and even interactive widgets. Jupyter Notebooks are very powerful because they allow you to easily share your findings with colleagues.

Because we'll be using Jupyter Notebooks, you'll need to install Anaconda before proceeding. Please see this [guide on how to install Anaconda](https://nickmccullum.com/python-course/how-to-install-anaconda/) for more details
