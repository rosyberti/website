It's now time for some practice problems! See below for details on how to proceed.

## Course Repository & Practice Problems

All of the code for this course's practice problems can be found in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/nicholasmccullum/advanced-python).

There are two options that you can use to complete the practice problems:

* Open them in your browser with a platform called Binder using [this link](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/nicholasmccullum/advanced-python/master) (recommended)
* Download the repository to your local computer and open them in a Jupyter Notebook using Anaconda (a bit more tedious)

Note that binder can take up to a minute to load the repository, so please be patient. 

Within that repository, there is a folder called `starter-files` and a folder called `finished-files`. You should open the appropriate practice problems within the `starter-files` folder and only consult the corresponding file in the `finished-files` folder if you get stuck.

The repository is public, which means that you can suggest changes using a pull request later in this course if youâ€™d like.
