## Slack Community

I want this course to be a personal experience. Because of that, I have created a Slack community for students to ask questions and interact with each other!

For those unfamiliar, Slack is a team messaging platform primarily used by businesses. Think MSN Messenger, but 10x better. I've used Slack in various capacities over the years and have always been pleased with my experience.

## Course Repository & Practice Problems

All of the code for this course's practice problems can be found in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/nicholasmccullum/learn-python).

There are two options that you can use to complete the practice problems:

* Open them in your browser with a platform called Binder using [this link](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/nicholasmccullum/learn-python/master) (recommended)
* Download the repository to your local computer and open them in a Jupyter Notebook using Anaconda (a bit more tedious)

Note that Binder can take up to a minute to load the repository, so please be patient. 

Within that repository, there is a folder called `starter-files` and a folder called `finished-files`. You should open the appropriate practice problems within the `starter-files` folder and only consult the corresponding file in the `finished-files` folder if you get stuck.

The repository is public, which means that you can suggest changes using a pull request later in this course if youâ€™d like. 

## What To Do If You Get Stuck

If you're working through this course and are stuck on a difficult problem, here's what you should do:

* __Google for a solution__: This is not just me being lazy! Real-world software developers often have to Google for solutions to their problems, so getting practice at this from the start is very beneficial.
* __Ask a question in the Slack community__: Other students further into this course will be more than willing to help you.
* __Email me__: You can use [this link](mailto:nicholasmccullum@gmail.com) to email me. While I always love hearing from students, please exhaust the other two options first since I might not reply right away.

## About Me

My name is Nick McCullum and I have worked in quantitative finance and computer programming for my entire career. I'm currently working as the President of Sure Dividend, where I built our technology stack from scratch, including:

* Python scripts deployed on AWS EC2 and AWS Lambda
* a PostgreSQL relational database on AWS RDS 
* a client-facing Wordpress site featuring a members-only login area

and more.
