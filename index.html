<p>My name is Nick and I live in Fredericton, New Brunswick. I am the <a href="https://www.suredividend.com">President of Sure Dividend</a>, an investment research firm based in Houston, Texas.</p>

<p>I maintain this website for three reasons:</p>

<ul>

  <li>To help people <a href="https://nickmccullum.com/learn-to-code/">learn to code</a>.</li>

  <li>In case you want to <a href="https://nickmccullum.com/hire-me/">hire me</a>. While much of my time is consumed with running Sure Dividend, I happily take on freelance software projects from time to time if they're interesting enough.</li>

</ul>
